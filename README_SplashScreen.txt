ReadMe.txt

To use this example that I have modified:

1. Download it.
2. Extract the file to the Visual Studio Projects folder under Documents -> Visual Studio -> Projects.
	Full file path of directory C:\Users\Girls Who Code\Documents\Visual Studio\Projects
3.Once extracted, open Visual Studio. Go to File -> Open -> Project
4.Open the SplashExample App
5.Once completely open, try to run this code. 
	Use Android_Accelerated option (only if you do not have Android_Accelerated, use 7" KitKat) 
	
If there are problems let me know. The main.axml file is your main page - not your splash page. Replace the 
splash_logo.png under the Resources -> Drawable folder with your desired image. 

I made a second layout called options. It is not connected to anything yet, but if you need another page
for something, do it on the options.axml. I can help with the navigation between pages if needed.
